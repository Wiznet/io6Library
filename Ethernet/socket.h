 * @defgroup WIZnet_socket_APIs 1. WIZnet socket APIs
 * @brief WIZnet socket APIs are based on Berkeley socket APIs,  thus it has much similar name and interface.
 *        But there is a little bit of difference.
 * @details
 * <b> Comparison between WIZnet and Berkeley SOCKET APIs </b>
 * <table>
 *    <tr> <td><b>API       </b></td> <td><b>WIZnet</b></td> <td><b>Berkeley</b></td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>socket()  </b></td> <td>O            </td> <td>O              </td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>bind()    </b></td> <td>X            </td> <td>O              </td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>listen()  </b></td> <td>O            </td> <td>O              </td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>connect() </b></td> <td>O            </td> <td>O              </td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>accept()  </b></td> <td>X            </td> <td>O              </td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>recv()    </b></td> <td>O            </td> <td>O              </td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>send()    </b></td> <td>O            </td> <td>O              </td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>recvfrom()</b></td> <td>O            </td> <td>O              </td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>sendto()  </b></td> <td>O            </td> <td>O              </td> </tr>
 *    <tr> <td><b>closesocket()</b></td> <td>O<br>close() & disconnect()</td> <td>O</td> </tr>
 * </table>
 * There are <b>bind()</b> and <b>accept()</b> functions in <b>Berkeley SOCKET API</b> but, not in <b>WIZnet SOCKET API</b>. \n
 * Because socket() of WIZnet is not only creating a SOCKET but also binding a local port number, \n
 * and listen() of WIZnet is not only listening to connection request from client but also accepting the connection request. \n
 * When you program "TCP SERVER" with Berkeley SOCKET API, you can use only one listen port. \n
 * When the listen SOCKET accepts a connection request from a client, it keeps listening. \n
 * After accepting the connection request, a new SOCKET is created and the new SOCKET is used in communication with the client. \n
 * Following figure shows network flow diagram by Berkeley SOCKET API. \n
 *  <table width=0 >
 *  <tr> <td>@image html Berkeley_SOCKET.jpg "<Berkeley SOCKET API>"</td> </tr>
 *  </table>
 * But, When you program "TCP SERVER" with WIZnet SOCKET API, you can use as many as 8 listen SOCKET with same port number. \n
 * Because there's no accept() in WIZnet SOCKET APIs, when the listen SOCKET accepts a connection request from a client, \n
 * it is changed in order to communicate with the client.\n
 * And the changed SOCKET is not listening any more and is dedicated for communicating with the client. \n
 * If there're many listen SOCKET with same listen port number and a client requests a connection, \n
 * the SOCKET which has the smallest SOCKET number accepts the request and is changed as communication SOCKET. \n
 * Following figure shows network flow diagram by WIZnet SOCKET API.
